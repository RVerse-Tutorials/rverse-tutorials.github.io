<span id="pkgsboxtext1">VRAP is the original code used for RER analyses.  Includes covariates.  VRAP can be run from a graphical interface from the NWFSC Shiny Server [VRAP Shiny](https://dataexplorer.northwestscience.fisheries.noaa.gov/nwc/VRAP/).</span>

<span id="pkgsboxtext1">VRAPS (VRAP second generation) is a C++ version of VRAP that is much faster and allows batch jobs.  Covariates are not used in VRAPS. Instead autocorrelation in survival is modeled using autoregressive models for survival.</span>

<span id="pkgsboxtext1">DMVRAPS uses DM output (posteriors on SR function parameters) as input to VRAPS.  Output is RERs with uncertainty estimates.</span>
